This is an assignment for the tenth week.

In this assignment, we will build upon our previous work to analyze the game log data:

Update your game logs to include data that allows you to know which square was played first and whether the game resulting in a win, loss or draw by that first player
Generate at least 30 games played in your logs
Provide some descriptive statistics about the game logs, including the new data, using Pandas
Build a simple linear regression model to understand which position is best to start the game with using scikit-learn
Report the model fit parameters and the likelihood of winning from each game position (which can be simplified to corner, center, or middle)
You do not need to worry about training vs testing data
