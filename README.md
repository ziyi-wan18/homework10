# techin509b-tictactoe
Please submit the link to your Google Colab notebook in the following format: "https://drive.google.com/"

In the first text cell of the notebook, add the link to your Github repository that includes the logs and related code in the following format: "https://github.com/xxxxxxx/repository_name.git"

Implement the additional features to your TicTacToe game:

The game should record all the winners in a 'database' file, which can just be a CSV or text file in the logs directory
The log file should contain any relevant data needed to perform statistics about the game and players
Using the Google Colab notebook environment, upload the log file and import and read the logs in the Colab notebook
Report on at least 3 interesting statistics about the games and players using tables (e.g. global ranks, wins/losses/draws, etc).
Create at least 3 plots of the game and player data using Matplotlib 
The code used to record data during the game needs to be added to your repository
Note: when you create log data for this assignment, you need to Add and commit that data also to your repository, so that it can be later uploaded to the Google Colab site. This will allow the grader to log your log data and re-run the cells in your notebook
